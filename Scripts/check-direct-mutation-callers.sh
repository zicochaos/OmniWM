# Phase 01 closure enforcement artifact for the "no new direct mutation
# callers" policy.
#
# Phase 01 made the runtime/domain runtime surface the authoritative
# transaction entrypoint for durable WM state mutation. Phase closure keeps
# migration-debt and ownership-boundary allowlists empty; owner files are
# excluded structurally rather than counted as compatibility rows.
#
# The script grep's for direct callers and fails CI if any new ones
# appear outside the counted rules. Unlike a whole-file allowlist, each
# entry pins the exact pattern count allowed in one file so
# already-migrated files cannot grow new direct mutation calls invisibly.
#
# Future phases that promote individual `WMCommand`s or replace
# compatibility writes should remove or tighten the matching ownership
# boundary entry as the direct call goes away.

# budget (sum of per-rule `max-count` values) so the migration completion
# gate (Phase 07 GOV-03 condition 1) can be observed without running the
# enforcement loop. `--budget-gate` prints the same report and fails if the
